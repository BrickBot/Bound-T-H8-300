Changes to lp_solve by Tidorum Ltd for use with Bound-T


CVS tags are constructed as follows: L<lp_solve vs>T<tidorum vs>.
For example, L3T1 means lp_solve version 3(.0); Tidorum version 1.

2014-07-21; CVS tag L3T3
   Changes for Mac OS/X, 64-bit host, with Clang:
   - In lpglob.h, changed the type of yyleng from "int" to YYLENG_T,
     because (some) 64-bit systems use "size_t", others still use "int".
   - In Makefile.macosx, changed LEXLIB to use the OS/X-provided "libl"
     instead of the more common "libfl" which is not available on OS/X,
     and to define YYLENG_T=size_t. Also hanged the C compiler options
     to check for the C99 standard instead of the ANSI standard, to
     avoid heaps of warnings for the use of PRIuMAX in some formats
     (change introduced in tag L3T2).
   - In Makefile.linux, changed the C compiler options to use C99, and
     to define YYLENG_T=int.

2013-12-07; CVS tag L3T2
   To make the MALLOC macros (in lpkit.h) compile without warnings on
   64-bit systems, changed their printf formats to use the C90/99
   format code PRIuMAX with the argument (the allocation size)
   converted to uintmax_t, There should be no change in function
   for little-endian (Intel) hosts with allocation sizes no
   greater than 4 GB.

2008-05-28; CVS tag L3T1
   Further modification to lpkit.c by Tidorum for use with Bound-T:
   Increased the number of digits in the print-out of the variable
   values (execution counts, for Bound-T), so that even large
   values are printed as integers.

2002-12-23
   Modification to lpkit.c by SSF for use with Bound-T:
   Increased the number of digits in the print-out of the objective
   function value, in print_solution(), so that even large values
   are printed as integers.

2002-12-23
   Starting from lp_solve 3.0.
