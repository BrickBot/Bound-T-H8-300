The files in this directory are extracted from the EPFL-LGL Abstract Data
Types library (see the files Copyright, README and conditions.txt) for use
in the Bound-T execution time analysis tool, originally developed by Space
Systems Finland Ltd and currently developed and sold by Tidorum Ltd.

For easier use with the GNU Ada compiler (GNAT), the files were renamed
to follow the GNAT convention where the suffix ".ads" is used for a
declaration file (spec file) and the suffix ".adb" for a body file.

In addition, Tidorum has made a few minor modifications in the content
of some of these files, as shown by the version history log. Tidorum claims
no copyright for these modifications.
