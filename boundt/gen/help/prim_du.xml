<option option="prim_du">
For assertions that identify loops by the cells (variables)
that are "defined" or "used" in the loop, this option
enables the inclusion of the cells referenced
in the "primitive" model of the computation, before the
model is refined by constant propagation and arithmetic
analysis. This can find more defined/used cells.
