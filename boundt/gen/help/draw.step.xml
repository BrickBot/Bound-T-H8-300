<option option="draw step">
Show the "step-address" of each node. This is the unique identifier of
the node in terms of the target processor's state when the node is
entered at execution. The machine address of the first instruction of
the node (the Program Counter) is usually the main part of the
step-address, but the step-address often includes other state
components, too. This option is often used together with the
option <prefixed-option-ref prefix="draw" option="step_graph"/>.
