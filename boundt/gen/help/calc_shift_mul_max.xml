<option option="calc_shift_mul_max">
Specifies the maximum amount (bit positions) of left-shift
which the arithmetic analysis can model as a multiplication
by 2**shift. For larger shifts the result is opaque.
Note that when this option is set to <i>M</i> bits, say, the
option <option-ref option="calc_max"/> is automatically  increased
to at least 2**M.
