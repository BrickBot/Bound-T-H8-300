<option option="calc_mod_max">
Specifies the maximum operand width (bits per number) for
which the arithmetic analysis uses modular formulas (residues) in
comparisons (&lt;, &lt;=, =, &gt;=, &gt;). For wider numbers the
non-modular, unbounded integer comparisons are used.
If the number is zero, modular formulas are never used.
Note that the value of the option <option-ref option="calc_max"/>
is automatically increased to at least 2**(calc_mod_max).<br/>
WARNING: Modular arithmetic analysis is experimental and
often fails, perhaps by aborting the Omega Calculator.
