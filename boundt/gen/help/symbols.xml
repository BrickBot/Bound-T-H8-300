<option option="symbols">
Specifies (the name of) a symbol-file to be read. The default is to
use no symbol file, and to use only the symbols from the target-
program file (debug info). This option can be used several times to
name several symbol files. Each use of <option-ref option="symbols"/>
adds one file-name to the set.
