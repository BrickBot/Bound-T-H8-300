<option option="draw min">
Draw a flow-graph that shows the minimum worst-case time-bound,
over all calls of the subprogram included in the present WCET
analysis. Note that this is not the best-case execution time of
the subprogram, but the smallest (usually context-specific) worst-case
execution time bound found in the present analysis for this
subprogram.
