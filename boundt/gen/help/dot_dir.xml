<option option="dot_dir">
Enables the drawing of call-graphs and control-flow graphs, placing
each graph in its own DOT file in a given directory. The name of this
directory is given as the value of the <option-ref option="dot_dir"/>
option. The file-name for each drawing is generated from the name of
the subprogram and the type of the drawing. See also the option
<option-ref option="dot"/>. By default no drawings are
made.
