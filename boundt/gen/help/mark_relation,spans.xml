<option-value option="mark_relation" value="spans">
The program part spans the line holding the marker, corresponding to
an assertion of the form "&lt;part&gt; that spans &lt;marker&gt;". In other
words, the source-line number of the marker lies within the range of
source-line numbers connected to the program part, but need not be
exactly one of them.
