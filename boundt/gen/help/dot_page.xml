<option option="dot_page">
Divides the drawings (see the <option-ref option="dot"/> option) into
pages of the given size, for example -dot_page=a4. The value of the
option is the DOT page-size string. By default the drawings are
unpaged and the drawing scale is reduced to fit each drawing in one
physical page.
