<option option="max_par_depth">
The bounds of a loop in a subprogram, and other dynamic behaviour of
the subprogram, may depend on actual parameter values passed from the
caller(s), perhaps over many call levels. This option sets the maximum
number of call levels over which parameter values are analysed to find
such call-dependent loop-bounds and other dynamic behaviour.
