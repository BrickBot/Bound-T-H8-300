<option option="dump">
Dumps the contents of the target program executable file
as text on standard output, instead of analysing the program.
The form and content of the dump depends on the format
of the executable file (e.g. ELF or COFF) and on the target
processor.
This option disables the analysis, so there should be no
root subprogram names on the command-line after the name
of the target program executable file. Moreover, the
<option-ref option="hrt"/> option should not be used together
with <option-ref option="dump"/>.
</option>
