<option option="mark">
Specifies (the name of) a source-code mark-definition file to be read.
The marks can then be used in assertions to identify the program parts
to which assertions apply.
The default is no mark file. This option can be used multiple times to
specify multiple mark files. Each use of <option-ref option="mark"/>
adds one mark-definition file. Mark-definition files are usually
automatically generated from source-code files, where marks are embedded
as comments. Tidorum provides the program "find_marks"
for generating mark-definition files from source code.
