<option option="max_listed_values">
The maximum number of discrete values that can be listed (enumerated)
from the computed bounds on some expression. Such lists are used
mainly to resolve dynamic jumps and mainly switch/case statements,
where this number sets a limit on the number of case branches enumerated
from the bounds deduced for the switch index expression.
This limit guards against generating over-estimated control-flow
graphs with millions of branches, which could otherwise happen
if the analysis cannot find good bounds on such expressions.
