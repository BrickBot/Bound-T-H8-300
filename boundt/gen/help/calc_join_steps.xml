<option option="calc_join_steps">
During arithmetic analysis, the computations represented in the
flow-graph elements (steps) are translated to Presburger relations.
This option determines whether the translation joins consecutive
steps from one basic block into a joint data-flow-relation (joint
arithmetic effect) which covers as many steps as possible (before some
storage cell is reassigned a second new value). The aim is to
simplify the Presburger expression of the data-flow by reducing the
number of "copy" constraints and the number of joined relations.
