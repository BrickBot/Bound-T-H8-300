<option option="const">
Enables constant-propagation analysis. Constant propagation is applied
to subprograms before the arithmetic analysis. Constant propagation is
sometimes necessary to analyse non-arithmetic operations such as
bitwise logical and/or/xor and the like. Constant propagation by
itself is often sufficient to analyse stack usage.
