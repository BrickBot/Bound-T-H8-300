<option option="max_loop">
An upper limit on credible or useful loop iteration bounds.
Sometimes Bound-T computes upper bounds on loop iterations
that are far larger than the true bounds. For example, if the
loop counter is 32 bits, Bound-T sometimes finds a loop-bound
on the order of 2^31 or 2^32. If <option-ref option="max_loop"/>
is set to a finite value, Bound-T ignores any larger computed
loop-bound and (if possible) looks for sharper loop-bounds by
context-specific analysis.
The default value of this option depends on the target processor.
