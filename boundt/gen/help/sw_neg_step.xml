<option option="sw_neg_step">
Whether to convert a deduced large induction-variable step
that represents a small negative step, to that small negative
step. For example, in some cases an 8-bit step of -1 is
represented in the code or intermediate analysis results by
a positive step of 255, relying on wrap-around of two's
complement addition. This option lets the analysis assume
that adding 255 to an 8-bit induction variable is the same
as subtracting 1 from the variable, as far as the resulting
value of the variable is concerned.
