<option option="max_stack">
An upper limit on the absolute value of credible or useful
stack-height bounds.
Sometimes Bound-T computes bounds on the stack height that are far
wider than the true bounds. For example, if the stack pointer is
32 bits, Bound-T sometimes finds stack-height bounds on the order
of 2^31 or 2^32. If <option-ref option="max_stack"/> is set to a
finite value, Bound-T ignores any computed upper or lower bound on
stack-height with a larger absolute value, and (if possible) looks
for sharper stack-height bounds by context-specific analysis.
The default value of this option depends on the target processor.
