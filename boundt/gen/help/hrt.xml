<option option="hrt">
<p>Selects the "HRT mode" of operation for Bound-T. The target program is assumed
to consist of some concurrent threads and some protected objects with mutually
exclusive operations, as listed in the "TPO file". Use Bound-T with a command
line of this form:
</p>
<p><dl>
<dt>boundt_&lt;target&gt; <option-ref option="hrt"/> [options] TPO-file</dt>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
Arguments:
</p>
<p><dl>
<dt><option-ref option="hrt"/></dt>
<dd>The option to invoke HRT mode. It does not have to be the
first option.
</dd>
<dt>[options]</dt>
<dd>Other options to control and guide the analysis.
</dd>
<dt>TPO-file</dt>
<dd>The name of the Threads and Protected Objects file.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>Note that the command line does not name any subprograms to
be analysed, since this is defined by the contents of the TPO file.
</p>
<p>For more guidance, for example on the format of the TPO file, please
refer to the manual "Using Bound-T in HRT Mode", document reference
TR-UM-002, at http://www.bound-t.com/manuals/hrt-manual.pdf.
