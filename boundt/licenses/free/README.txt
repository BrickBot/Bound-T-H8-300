This folder provides Bound-T "licence" files suitable for an
open-source, free-beer-and-speech distribution of Bound-T:

- both WCET and stack analysis ("time-and-space")
- no time limit ("eternal")
- no program size limit ("size-any")

Note that the "formats" modules defining the secrecry of the
AOMF2 and UBROF formats are not present, because the open-source
distribution does not support AOMF2 or UBROF.
