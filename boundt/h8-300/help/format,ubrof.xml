The UBROF (Universal Binary Relocatable Object Format) defined by
IAR Systems for their compilers. This format is not supported by the
open-source versions of Bound-T, because the definition of UBROF is
proprietary and the Bound-T module reading UBROF was created by
Tidorum under an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) with IAR Systems.
