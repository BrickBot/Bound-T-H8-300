<option option="uu">
Specifies which registers can be changed (trashed)
by a callee. Use the same option as for the compiler.

For historical reasons, this option can also be written
without an equal sign, for example 
<option-ref option="uu1"/>
instead of <option-value-ref option="uu" value="1"/>.
</option>
