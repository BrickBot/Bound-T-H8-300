Tidorum's changes to Omega 2.1 for Bound-T needs
------------------------------------------------

Log started 2009-02-08.

CVS tags use the form "Om<omega version>T<Tidorum version>".
For example Om21T1 means Omega 2.1, Tidorum version 1.


2009-11-14; CVS tag Om21T3.
   Updates for compiling Omega Calculator under new MinGW
   (gcc 4.4.0) with flex and bison from the GnuWin32 project.

   basic/include/basic/String.h
      MS-Windows does not support the standard 64-bit integer
      format specifier %lld. Using %I64d" instead, depending on
      the preprocessor definition of WIN32.

   basic/include/basic/assert.h
      Removed apparently useless or obnoxius definitions of
      the _assert macro/statement.

   basic/include/basic/util.h
      Removed outdated WIN32-specific definitions of LONGLONG
      and MAXLONGLONG.

   omega_lib/include/omega/omega_core/oc.h
      MS-Windows does not support the standard 64-bit integer
      format specifier %lld, used for the 64-bit "coef_fmt".
      Using %I64d" instead, depending on the preprocessor
      definition of WIN32.

   omega_lib/src/farkas.c
      Removed outdated WIN32-specific definition of ONELONGLONG.

2009-02-27
   Updated Omega Calculator to use "coef_t" instead of "int",
   thus allowing 64-bit calculations.
   CVS tag: om2_tr_2.

   omega_lib/include/omega/omega_core/oc.h
      For each alternative definition of "coef_t", added also
      a definition (#define) "a_to_coef" for the function that
      parses a decimal digit string into a "coef_t" value.
      For "int" it is atoi, for "long long" it is atoll.

   omega_lib/include/omega/AST.h
   omega_lib/src/AST.c
      For all operations on Expr where a parameter represents
      a coef_t, changed the parameter type from "int" to "coef_t".
      In AST.c also changed printf statements to use the defined
      "coef_fmt" instead of "%d".

   omega_calc/src/parser.y
      Changed the type of the INT_VALUE attribute from "int"
      to "coef_t".

   omega_calc/src/parser.l
      Changed the rule for an integer literal to set INT_VALUE
      from "a_to_coef", yielding a "coef_t", instead of "atoi",
      yielding an "int".

2009-02-12
   Makefile.config
      Added SPEED to the compilation options.

   In omega_calc/src:

   parser.y
      Added "Tidorum" and the size of coef_t to the
      greeting line. Observation: coef_t is 64 bits,
      which should/may enable modular analysis of
      32-bit arithmetic. Excellent.

Repetition of Tidorum changes to Omega 1.1, if necessary:
From Tidorum's change log for this Omega version:

2006-10-17
   Makefile.config
      Modified to build oc under MinGW with an older flex or
      under Linux with a newer flex. This is handled with the
      new variables YYFLAGS and LEXFLAGS, to be set on the make
      command line (see make_oc_mingw.sh and make_oc_linux.sh).
      Added the following options to COMPILER_CFLAGS:
      -DOMIT_GETRUSAGE; MinGW has no include/sys/resource.h.
      $(YYFLAGS); to accommodate different flex versions.

   Makefile.rules
      Changed flex option --always-interactive to $(LEXFLAGS)
      where LEXFLAGS should be set on the make command line
      according to the flex version in use.

   make_oc_mingw.sh
   make_oc_linux.sh
      Added these brief scripts to call "make oc" with the
      proper parameters for making oc under MinGW or Linux,
      respectively. The difference is in the flex version.

   In omega_calc/src:

   parser.l
      Reinstated definition of YY_ALWAYS_INTERACTIVE.
      Reinstated declaration and initialization of yylineno,
      optional on YY_ALWAYS_INTERACTIVE.

   parser.y
      Commented out the "assert(DebugFile)" in the SPEED case,
      when DebugFile is opened on /dev/null. Under MinGW this
      fopen seems to return zero, but writes to DebugFile are
      indeed without effect (and no oc.out file is created).

2006-10-10

   omega_lib/include/omega/omega_core/oc.h
      Increased maxVars from 200 to 300.

   omega_lib/include/omega/omega_core/oc_i.h
      Changed maxWildcards from 18 to 50.
